JuJu Cast - The Diaspora
========================

This is a "game" for minetest.  In it, you are set on a team based on what color Juju you manifest.  Black, Pink, White, Green, or Red.

As a Shaman, you cast your juju to manifest your mascots.  They may or may not attack you based on their juju affinity.

To manifest the mascots (mobs) you use manifesting eggs. (spawning eggs) Then tail the other shamen.


Based on "Capture The Flag" by Ruben "Wardy" Ward.
